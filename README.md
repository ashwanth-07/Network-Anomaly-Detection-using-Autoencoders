# Network-Anomaly-Detection-using-Autoencoders

Embark on a cybersecurity journey with our PyTorch-based neural network classifier, specifically designed for NSL-KDD data. This project focuses on the careful preparation of NSL-KDD data, including normalization of numerical attributes and one-hot encoding of categorical attributes.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preparation:** Streamline the preprocessing of NSL-KDD data by normalizing numerical attributes and implementing one-hot encoding for categorical attributes.

2. **Neural Network Design:** Delve into the core of the project with a PyTorch-based neural network that emphasizes the construction of encoders and decoders. 

3. **Hyper-Parameter Optimization:** Model performance was enhanced by fine-tuning hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate and reconstruction error threshold. 

4. **Performance Evaluation:** The neural network attains a 89% accuracy on the NSL-KDD validation dataset.
